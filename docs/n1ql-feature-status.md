## Introduction

This document specifies the features of N1QL DP4 and Sherlock, and
their current status for QE.

The document also indicates the status of features with respect to
Couchbase datastore and file-based datastore.

See the N1QL [SELECT
spec](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/query/blob/master/docs/n1ql-select.md),
[DDL
spec](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/query/blob/master/docs/n1ql-ddl.md),
and [DML
spec](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/query/blob/master/docs/n1ql-dml.md).

## Feature Status

### REST API

The REST API is defined at [Query REST
API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uyv4t06DNGq7TxJjGI_T_MbbEYf8Er-imC7yzTY0uZw/edit#heading=h.lfqenz86v2rl). It
is 80% implemented, and should be fully implemented and testable by
11/20/2014.

### Expressions

Expressions are implemented and testable, with the following
exceptions:

+ OBJECT is not yet implemented.

+ The following operators do not yet support the `name-var :` syntax
for ranging over attribute names.

    + WITHIN

    + ANY / SOME / EVERY

    + ARRAY / FIRST / OBJECT

### SELECT

SELECT is implemented and testable, with the following exceptions:

+ Index selection is not yet implemented, so a primary index is always
used.

+ LETTING without GROUP BY is not yet implemented.

### EXPLAIN

EXPLAIN is implemented, but the output format is still being
fine-tuned. It is ready for manual testing, but automated tests may
break if the format changes.

### PREPARE

PREPARE is implemented, but the output format is possibly subject 
to change. It is ready for manual testing, but automated tests may 
break if the format changes. PREPARE returns the query plan and
signature of the given statement.

### CREATE INDEX

CREATE INDEX is implemented for view indexes. Only a subset of
expressions is supported for the index expressions; other expressions
will generate a "not implemented" or "not supported" message.

Secondary indexes will be integrated in the coming weeks.

### CREATE PRIMARY INDEX

CREATE PRIMARY INDEX is implemented for view indexes.

Secondary indexes will be integrated in the coming weeks.

### DROP INDEX

DROP INDEX is implemented for view indexes.

Secondary indexes will be integrated in the coming weeks.

### DROP PRIMARY INDEX

DROP PRIMARY INDEX is implemented for view indexes.

Secondary indexes will be integrated in the coming weeks.

### ALTER INDEX

ALTER INDEX is __not__ in scope for DP4 or Sherlock.

### INSERT

The syntax for INSERT has changed. As of 12/22/2014, the new syntax
has been implemented according to the spec.

### UPSERT

The syntax for UPSERT has changed. As of 12/22/2014, the new syntax
has been implemented according to the spec.

### DELETE

DELETE is implemented and testable for Couchbase and file-based
datastores.

### UPDATE

UPDATE is implemented and testable for Couchbase and file-based
datastores.

### MERGE

MERGE is implemented and testable for Couchbase and file-based
datastores. The current implementation is known to cause a crash See
[MB-12327](http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-12327).

## Additional features for Sherlock

### Secondary indexes

All index operations will be supported on GSI indexes, in addition to
view indexes.

+ CREATE PRIMARY INDEX
+ CREATE INDEX
+ DROP INDEX
+ SELECT * FROM system:indexes

### Indexing hints

Product Management has requested index hints that allow users to
specify which index will be used. See MB-12219.

### SASL buckets

SASL buckets are supported in Sherlock. Every query and every type of
statement can access both SASL and non-SASL buckets. Also, a single
statement that contains JOINs or subqueries can access any combination
of multiple SASL and non-SASL buckets.

### Subqueries in FROM clause

Based on user feedback, we have added the ability to have subqueries
in a FROM clause. A subquery in a FROM clause may or may not have a
USE KEYS clause. In this case, the USE KEYS clause is optional.

### Output formats

The output formats should be fairly stable now. This applies to
results, signatures, EXPLAIN, REST API, and other responses.

The error messages have also been designed and are being implemented
and stabilized.
